# CoronaCoprosperityCard_DataScience
This project is a card product proposal modeling project using Data Science.

The purpose is to promote consumption activities, which have shrunk to Corona 19, by presenting new card benefits tailored to changed consumption patterns, so that consumers and producers can coexist.

We used the card data provided by Dacon, and we used the card payment data by age and the sales increase and decrease rate in 2020 compared to 2019.

Using the data pre-processed above, we printed the similarity between industries using pre-trained word2vec, and we used k-means to cluster similar clusters.
Then, We proceeded with new card modeling by making card benefits into Word Cloud according to the selected cluster.
